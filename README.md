# Hackathon Submission: Customer Experience Enhancement with Public Data and Generative AI

## Introduction
This repository contains the submission of Team 10 for the Hackathon organized by EESTEC LC Aachen in partnership with Infineon. Our project aims to enhance customer experience using public data and generative AI.

## Problem Statement
The topic of the hackathon is "How can we improve customer experience with public data and generative AI?". Our team proposes a solution using a Language Model (LLM)-based model. The model provides feedback to different personas, acting as customers, by analyzing their comments and suggesting improvements. More deatils on problem statement can be found at [github](https://github.com/Infineon/hackathon)

## Solution Overview
Our solution is based on a Language Model (LLM) that analyzes customer comments and provides tailored feedback to improve their experience. We have identified and defined customer experience metrics, both abstract and non-abstract, by considering various customer personas and viewpoints. By leveraging public data and generative AI, our model offers effective and consistent predictions on how issues and comments can be handled better to enhance customer satisfaction.

## Key Features
- Language Model (LLM)-based solution
- Feedback generation for different customer personas
- Analysis of abstract and non-abstract customer experience metrics
- Leveraging public data and generative AI for enhanced predictions

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: We gather customer comments and related data from public sources.
2. **Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.
3. **Model Training**: We train the Language Model (LLM) using the preprocessed data.
4. **Feedback Generation**: The model analyzes customer comments and generates feedback tailored to different personas.
5. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the effectiveness of the feedback generated by the model using various metrics.

## Getting Started
To get started with our project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script to train the model and generate feedback.
